<p>In the Summer of 2001, Dad and I bicycled across the country, from Los Angeles to Boston.  This page is a commemoration of the adventure, for each of the 49 days I have posted both my log entry, dad's log entry, and a picture for the day.  I hope you enjoy the site, relive the trip by reading the logs, peruse the photos, or drop us a note at <a href="mailto:klbrown@purdue.edu">klbrown@purdue.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:browns@iquest.net">browns@iquest.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you are considering a cross-country trip or are shopping for the best company to tour with, I have to whole-heartedly recommend checking out <a href="http://www.crossroadscycling.com">CrossRoads Cycling</a>.  Very rarely do you find anyone who both enjoys and excels at their job to the level that Tracy, the leader and organizer, does every day.  The staff is wonderful, they really know how to take care of both the rider and the bike, and riding with a supportive, tightly-knit group makes the tour a blast.  If you want to know more, drop dad or me or dad an e-mail, of you can drop Tracy a line from the CrossRoads website.</p><br><hr><br>
